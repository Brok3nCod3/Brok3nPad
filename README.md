# Brok3nPad
My hackpad (it's really bad)

I spent no less than 12 hours on this, and due to family related issues (divorced parents) I'm unable to finish the QMK firmware, and can't access KiCad for a week after writing this.
I don't know how to add folders, I don't use Github that much.
I added everything I thought might be useful, and I don't have time to add a BOM or learn how to
Honestly, I'm just glad that people who saw what I was doing as they walked by thought I was smart because they didn't understand what I was doing (neither did I)
